# Exercise 2

So lets get started building a todo app:

    get fetch all
    git checkout ex2

Now you should have the skeleton of a Todo MVC App.

Lets run it and open it in the browser:

    npm start

Now we want to start by adding an TextInput component.

So in the components folder open the `TodoTextInput.react.js` file
and add the `Label` component to the render method.

Then add the TodoTextInput component into the app.js file.
